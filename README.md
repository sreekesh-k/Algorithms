# Algorithms
**Algorithms Practice Repository**

Welcome to my algorithms practice repository! Here, you'll find a collection of implementations for various fundamental algorithms that I've practiced and studied. From classic sorting and searching algorithms like bubble sort, insertion sort, and binary search, to more advanced techniques such as merge sort, divide and conquer, and greedy algorithms like Huffman coding and the knapsack problem.

**What's Included:**
- Basic sorting and searching algorithms
- Advanced algorithms including merge sort, divide and conquer
- Greedy algorithms such as Huffman coding and the knapsack problem
- Graph algorithms such as BFS,DFS and other algorithms

**Purpose:**
This repository serves as both a personal reference for me to revisit and review algorithms I've learned, as well as a resource for others who are studying algorithms. Whether you're a student looking to understand these concepts better or a professional seeking to refresh your knowledge, I hope this repository proves helpful.

**Contributions:**
I encourage contributions! If you find any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or want to add your own implementations of algorithms, feel free to submit a pull request. Together, we can make this repository a valuable resource.

Thank you for visiting, and happy coding!
